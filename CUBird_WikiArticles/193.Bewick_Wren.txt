the bewick's wren (thryomanes bewickii) is a wren native to north america .
 at about 14 cm (5.5 in) long , it is grey-brown above , white below , with a long white eyebrow .
 while similar in appearance to the carolina wren , it has a long tail that is tipped in white .
 the song is loud and melodious , much like the song of other wrens .
 the song is broken into two or three individual parts; one individual male may exhibit up to twenty-two different variations on the song pattern , and may even throw in a little ventriloquism to vary it even further .
 it lives in thickets , brush piles and hedgerows , open woodlands and scrubby areas , often near streams .
 it eats insects and spiders , which it gleans from vegetation or finds on the ground .
 wrens are sometimes observed foraging with chickadees and other birds .
its range is from southern british columbia , nebraska , southern ontario , and southwestern pennsylvania , maryland , south to mexico , arkansas and the northern gulf states .
 the bewick's wren does not migrate .
the nest is cup-shaped and located in a nook or cavity of some kind .
 it lays 57 eggs that are white with brown spots .
 the bewick's wren produces two broods in a season .
 pairs are more or less monogamous when it comes to breeding , but go solitary throughout the winter .
this is currently the only species of its genus , thryomanes .
 the socorro wren , formerly placed here too , is actually a close relative of the house wren complex , as indicated by biogeography and mtdna nadh dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis , whereas thryomanes seems not too distant from the carolina wren .
