the horned puffin (fratercula corniculata) is an auk , similar in appearance to the atlantic puffin; this bird's bill is yellow at the base and red at the tip . it is a pelagic seabird that feeds primarily by diving for fish . it nests in colonies , often with other auks . the yellow bill plate grows before the breeding season and is shed later . they have a small fleshy black "horn" above their eyes . they have a white face with a dark line extending from the back of the eye and red feet . this species breeds on rocky islands off the coasts of siberia , alaska and british columbia , in burrows , in rocky cavities or among rocks . it winters far out to sea . feeding areas are usually located fairly far offshore from the nest . there is usually one chick and both parents feed the young . horned puffins will return from hunting with several small fish in their beaks . they also eat squid and crustaceans . the population of these birds has declined due to the introduction of rats onto some islands used for nesting .
