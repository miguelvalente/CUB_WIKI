the pigeon guillemot (cepphus columba) is a species of bird in the auk family , alcidae . it is endemic to the pacific ocean . it closely resembles the other members of the genus cepphus , particularly the black guillemot , which is slightly smaller and lacks dark wing lines . adult birds have black bodies with a white wing patch broken by a black wedge , a thin dark bill and red legs and feet . in winter , the upper parts are mottled grey and black and the underparts are white . they walk well and habitually have an upright posture . their breeding habitat is rocky shores , cliffs and islands , often forming small loose colonies . they usually lay their eggs in rocky cavities near water , but will often nest in any available cavity including caves , disused burrows of other seabirds and even old bomb casings . unlike many alcids , pigeon guillemots are diurnal and lay two eggs . because they can feed their chicks constantly throughout the day , the chicks fledge faster than equivalent sized auks that are only provisioned at night . pigeon guillemots range across the northern pacific from the kuril islands and the kamchatka peninsula in siberia to coasts in western north america from alaska to california . after the breeding season birds in alaska migrate south to open waters , whereas some birds from california move north to the waters off british columbia . birds usually return to their natal colony to breed . they dive for food from the surface , swimming underwater , feeding on benthic prey , which is usually obtained close to shore . they mainly eat fish and other aquatic animals , particularly sculpins , sandfish (trichodon), cods , capelin , and crabs . chick diet varies slightly , with more fish than invertebrates , particularly rockfish .
