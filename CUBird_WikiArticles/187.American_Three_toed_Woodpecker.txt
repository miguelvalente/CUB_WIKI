the american three-toed woodpecker (picoides dorsalis) is a medium-sized woodpecker (family picidae) . this woodpecker has a length of 21 cm (8.3 in), a wingspan of 38 cm (15 in), and an average weight of 55 g (1.9 oz); its maximum lifespan in the wild is 6 years . it closely resembles the black-backed woodpecker , which is also three-toed . until recently , it was considered to be the same species as the eurasian three-toed woodpecker , (p . tridactylus) . adults are black on the head , wings and rump , and white from the throat to the belly; the flanks are white with black bars . the back is white with black bars and the tail is black with the white outer feathers barred with black . the adult male has a yellow cap . the breeding habitat is coniferous forests across western canada , alaska and the midwestern united states . it has also been breeding in various spots in michigan's upper peninsula . the female lays 3 to 7 but most often 4 eggs in a nest cavity in a dead conifer or sometimes a live tree or pole . the pair excavates a new nest each year . this bird is normally a permanent resident , but northern birds may move south and birds at high elevations may move to lower levels in winter . three-toed woodpeckers forage on conifers in search of wood-boring beetle larvae or other insects . they may also eat fruit and tree sap . these birds often move into areas with large numbers of insect-infested trees , often following a forest fire or flooding . this bird is likely to give way to the black-backed woodpecker where the two species compete for habitat .
