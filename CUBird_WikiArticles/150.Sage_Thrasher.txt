the sage thrasher (oreoscoptes montanus) is a medium-sized passerine bird from the family mimidae , which also includes mockingbirds , tremblers and new world catbirds . it is the only member of the genus oreoscoptes . this seems less close to the caribbean thrashers , but rather to the mockingbirds instead (hunt et al . 2001, barber et al . 2004) . o . montanus are pale grey-brown on the upperparts and white on the underparts with dark streaks . they have a slim straight relatively short bill , yellow eyes and a long tail , although not as long as that of other thrashers . as its name suggests , this bird breeds in western north america , from southern canada to northern arizona and new mexico . its breeding habitat is in areas with dense stands of sagebrush and rarely in other shrubby areas . the female lays 4 or 5 eggs in a twiggy cup nest built in a low bush . both parents incubate and feed the young birds . in winter , these birds migrate to the southernmost united states and mexico , including the baja peninsula , north and south . they mainly eat insects in summer; they also eat berries , especially in winter . they usually search for insects on the ground in brushy locations . the male bird sings a series of warbled notes to defend his nesting territory . these birds have declined in some areas where sagebrush has been removed but are still common where suitable habitat remains . the continued decline of sagebrush habitats in western north america is cause for alarm for this and other sagebrush dependent species .
