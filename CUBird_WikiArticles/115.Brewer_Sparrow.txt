brewer's sparrow (spizella breweri) is a small , slim species of american sparrow in the family emberizidae . this bird was named after the ornithologist thomas mayo brewer . adults have grey-brown backs and speckled brown crowns , both with dark streaks , and a pale eye-ring . their wings are brown with light wing bars and the underparts are pale grey . their bill is pale with a dark tip and they have a long notched tail . they are similar in appearance to the clay-colored sparrow (s . pallida) but do not have a pale stripe on the crown or grey neck patch . the male sings to defend a nesting territory . the song is a long varied mix of notes and trills . males have 2 distinct types of songs - classified as short and long songs . there are two distinct subspecies:these birds migrate to the southwestern united states south to central mexico . these birds forage primarily in shrubs or in low vegetation , but also on the ground . they mainly eat insects in summer with seeds becoming a more important part of the diet at other times of the year . they usually forage in flocks outside of the breeding season , sometimes with other sparrows . the female typically lays 3 to 4 eggs (up to 5) in a cup nest in low shrubs . brewer's sparrow has decreased in some parts of their range . causes are not well understood , but it is suspected that the decline is due at least in part to destruction of sagebrush habitat . additional information on resource use and limitation during the wintering season is desperately needed . when the timberline sparrow was still considered a good species , brewer's sparrow was classified as near threatened by the iucn . however , as only entire species are evaluated for the iucn red list , following the merger the entire population of s . breweri is classified as species of least concern .
