the black-billed cuckoo (coccyzus erythropthalmus) is a new world species in the cuculidae (cuckoo) family . the scientific name is from ancient greek . the genus name kokkuzo , means to call like a common cuckoo , and erythropthalmus is from eruthros , "red" and ophthalmos , "eye" . it is very similar and overlaps in range with the closely related yellow-billed cuckoo . a distinguishing characteristic of family cuculidae is laying eggs in the nests of other birds . although many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites , c . erythropthalmus often incubate their own chicks . adults have a long , graduated brown tail and a black , slightly downcurved bill . the head and upper parts are brown and the underparts are white . the feet are zygodactylous . juveniles are drabber and may contain some rufous coloration on the wing . the adults have a narrow , red orbital ring while the juveniles' is yellow . black-billed cuckoo chicks have white , sparsely-distributed , sheath-like down that contrasts heavily with their black skin . they also have complex , creamy-colored structures on their mouth and tongue , which may appear like warts or some type of parasitic infection however they are normal for the species . c . erythropthalmus may be found in a variety of habitats . they are most commonly found around the edges of mature deciduous or mixed forests and much less frequently in coniferous forests . they can also be found in much younger growth forests with a lot of shrubs and thickets . wetlands with a lot of alder and willow are another prime location to see them . lastly , they can also inhabit more open areas such as abandoned farmland , golf courses and residential parks . whatever the habitat may be , they are usually quite well hidden and tend to stick to the edges of these habitats . the chosen habitat must also have a water source nearby such as a lake , river , marsh or pond . on their wintering grounds in south america , they can inhabit tropical rainforests , deciduous or semiopen woodlands as well as scrub forests . when breeding , the species is distributed in wooded areas across much of the united states , east of the rockies . their range just barely extends into north carolina , arkansas , oklahoma and tennessee . they are not present to the south of those states when breeding . they can also be found in southern regions of alberta , saskatchewan , manitoba , ontario and quebec . they're also present in the maritime provinces of prince edward island , eastern new brunswick and western nova scotia . when migrating in spring and fall , they can also be seen in southern united states as well as all of central america . they migrate to northwestern south america in the fall , where they will spend the winter . although they are mainly an eastern north american species , there have been confirmed reports of them in british columbia , washington and california . the species is also a rare vagrant to western europe and greenland . these birds forage in shrubs or trees . they mainly eat insects , especially tent caterpillars , but also some snails , eggs of other birds and berries . it is known to beat caterpillars against a branch before consuming them to remove some of the indigestible hairs . remaining hairs accumulate in the stomach until the bird sheds the stomach lining and disgorges a pellet in a manner similar to owls . invasive gypsy moths may also serve as an important food source for black-billed cuckoos . most birds cannot consume gypsy moth caterpillars because of their hair-like setae however , cuckoos can consume them because of their ability to shed their abdominal lining . during outbreak years of these insects , the abundance of black-billed cuckoos increased on breeding bird survey (bbs) routes . this increase is not due to higher reproductive rate because then the black-billed cuckoo populations would only increase the next year . the abundance is higher because the cuckoos flock towards the outbreak areas . this is supported by the fact that cuckoo abundance is actually lower than average in the areas surrounding the outbreaks , suggesting a large influx of the birds towards outbreaks . they are able to find these areas due to post-migratory nomadic behavior . once reaching their breeding ground , they search vast expanses of forest for the most suitable breeding area , in this case , where there is an abundance of food . similar patterns have also been observed during outbreaks of tent caterpillars , fall webworms and cicadas . when they are a couple days old , the chicks can make a buzzing sound that resembles an insect and a few days later , they can make a low barking call when disturbed . the call of this species is 2-5 sets of "coo" notes that are high-pitched , rapid and repetitive . there is a slight pause between each set . the phonetics are often written "coo-coo-coo-coo , coo-coo-coo-coo , coo-coo-coo-coo , . . . " . adults usually call during the day when breeding however they begin calling at night , in the middle of summer . prior to copulation , the male lands on a branch near the female with an insect in its beak . the female will then flick her tail up and down intermittently for about 15 minutes while the male sits there motionless . the male then mounts the female , with the insect still in its mouth , and the two copulate . the male then either eats the food item or gives it to the female for her to eat . females usually lay 2-3 blue-green eggs , sometimes 4 or 5, which may take on a marbled appearance after a couple days of incubation . adults incubate the eggs for 1013 days . the young black-billed cuckoos , as well as others cuckoos in the genus coccyzus , leave the nest 79 days after hatching , which is quite young when compared to other birds . the young are not able to fly right away however they can still move quite large distances by jumping between tree branches . during this period , they are more vulnerable to predators because they cannot fly away as the adults could . due to this vulnerability , the juveniles can slowly assume an erect posture to conceal themselves . they stretch their neck out and point their bill upwards , while keeping their eyes open and remaining motionless . if the threat starts to back off , the cuckoo will relax its pose . outbreaks of tent caterpillars can have a positive effect on black-billed cuckoo populations . during these outbreaks , the adults begin laying eggs earlier in the season . they can also produce larger clutches and may even increase their parasitic activities . black-billed cuckoos are known to lay their eggs in the nests of other birds . they can lay eggs in the nests of other black-billed cuckoos , called conspecific parasitism , or in the nests of other songbirds , known as interspecific parasitism . the females will usually parasitize nests in the afternoon because the nests are often unguarded at this time . this cuckoo species is thought to have a laying interval of about a day so if two eggs show up in a nest on the same day , you can rightfully assume that one is a parasitic egg . many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites , meaning they only lay eggs in other birds' nests and never take care of their own young . birds that do this , such as the common cuckoo or the brown-headed cowbird , lay relatively small eggs because their expected hosts are usually smaller birds . cuckoos in the genus coccyzus , lay relatively large eggs even though they still parasitize smaller birds . yellow warblers are the smallest birds recorded caring for black-billed cuckoo eggs . in experiments , these wood warblers were found to accept the cuckoo eggs 63% of the time even though their own eggs are only a quarter of the size . even with the size difference , the warbler parent is often still able to raise the cuckoo as long as it can provide the chick with sufficient nutrition and incubation . the black-billed cuckoo was originally placed in genus cuculus . this genus comprises old world cuckoos that are all obligate brood parasites . upon further genetic testing , it was placed into genus coccyzus that comprises nine species of new world cuckoos . the black-billed and yellow-billed cuckoos are the only two that migrate into north america while the other seven are permanent residents of either central or south america . even though these two cuckoos overlap in range , they are not sister taxa . this suggests that the two species invaded north america separately . although family cuculidae is monophyletic , the genus coccyzus was found to be polyphyletic .
