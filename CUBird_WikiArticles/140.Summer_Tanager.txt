the summer tanager , piranga rubra , is a medium-sized american songbird . formerly placed in the tanager family (thraupidae), it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (cardinalidae) . the species's plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family . their breeding habitat is open wooded areas , especially with oaks , across the southern united states , extending as far north as iowa . these birds migrate to mexico , central america and northern south america . this tanager is an extremely rare vagrant to western europe . adults have stout pointed bills . adult males are rose red and similar in appearance to the hepatic tanager , although the latter has a dark bill; females are orangish on the underparts and olive on top , with olive-brown wings and tail . these birds are often out of sight , foraging high in trees , sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight . they mainly eat insects , especially bees and wasps , and berries . fruit of cymbopetalum mayanum (annonaceae) are an especially well-liked food in their winter quarters , and birds will forage in human-altered habitat . consequently , these trees can be planted to entice them to residential areas , and they may well be attracted to bird feeders . summer tanagers build a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch . the summer tanager has an american robin-like song , similar enough that novices sometimes mistake this bird for that species . the song consists of melodic units , repeated in a constant stream . the summer tanager's song , however , is much more monotonous than that of t . migratorius , often consisting of as few as 3 or 4 distinct units . it is clearer and less nasal than the song of the scarlet tanager . the summer tanager also has a sharp , agitated-sounded call pi-tuk or pik-i-tuk-i-tuk .
