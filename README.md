# CUB_WIKI

In the original [DataSet Repo](https://github.com/EthanZhu90/ZSL_PP_CVPR17)  (_Elhosein et .al_) there is no difference between CUBird_Sentences and CUBird_WikiArticles. In here you find the CUBird_WikiArticles as one single piece of text with numbered sentences removed. Easier to use wget/git clone.
